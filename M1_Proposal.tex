\section{M1 - Visualizing 1 billion stars}
\subsection{Project Type: Design study project}
The aim is to help  an expert to visualize  the huge dataset of  more than a million stars with different plots like bar charts and scatter plots and 3D visualization programs like "GLUE".\\
Goal of this visualization should be to find some star clusters around the sun or detect suspicious outliers in a bigger context than its usual in astronomy.\\
\subsection{Target application}
At the moment the target visualization will be consists of probably three parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tableau
\item D3
\item GLUE\\
\end{itemize}
We will use Tableau for prototyping to get a good overview which data we will use for final presentation and maybe have some early insights if there are some interesting correlations.\\
With D3 we try to make an interactive view for identifying different structures in the dataset.\\
GLUE is to visualize the data in a three dimensional context, which is desired by the customer (Joao Alves from the faculty of astronomy).\\
\\
Actually it is not really hard to accomplish the goal with existing tool, but according to our customer the main focus was always on small parts of the data. We will try to focus on the big picture and try to get some insight.\\
\subsection{Data}
The data are provided in the one hand from the official GAIA website \url{https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dr1} which consists of spherical coordinates and in the other hand from our customer who gave us special dataset for the visualization in GLUE.
\subsection{Users}
Since it is a specific task the only user, as far as we know, will be our customer to use it for his own research in this topic.
